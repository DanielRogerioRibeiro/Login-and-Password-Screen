<h1>Login-and-Password-Screen ®</h1>


This is a Login and Password screen where the user can check if the “Typed name” and “Password” actually belong to that user.


<h2>Purpose 🎯</h2>

The purpose of this program is to create a Login and Password Screen using the CustomTkinter library, Tkinter for editing the window.


<h2>Instructions 📖</h2>

A previous registration must be made in the “login.py” file, where the user's name and password must be informed so that the program can read and verify if the user exists.

If the user exists, the message "Hello...Welcome back + the user's name" will be displayed.

If the user does not exist in the list, a new message will be displayed with “"Verify the Name and/or Password".


Note: At any time, the user can click on the “Exit” button to exit the application.
